Functions
---------
what is a function?

its a block of organized, reusable code that performs a specific task

def function_name:
   print("hello world")

def factorial(n):    
	if n == 0 or n == 1:        
return 1    
else:        
return n * factorial(n - 1)
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"Factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")


Passing arguments
-----------------
1. Pass by value      - sharing the value
2. pass by reference  - sharing the address


Scope of a variable
-------------------
1. local	- lexical - loses its scope out of the block
2. global	- can be accessible throughout the code
3. non local    - nested functions
